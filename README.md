## Quick installation guide

### Requirements (Laravel)

 - Apache, nginx, or another compatible web server.
 - Laravel takes advantage of the powerful features that have become available in PHP 5.3. Consequently, PHP 5.3 is a requirement.
 - Laravel uses the FileInfo library to detect files' mime-types. This is included by default with PHP 5.3. However, Windows users may need to add a line to their php.ini file before the Fileinfo module is enabled. For more information check out the installation / configuration details on PHP.net.
 - Laravel uses the Mcrypt library for encryption and hash generation. Mcrypt typically comes pre-installed. If you can't find Mcrypt in the output of phpinfo() then check the vendor site of your LAMP installation or check out the installation / configuration details on PHP.net.

Find out more in [Laravel's official website](http://laravel.com/docs/install).
Or at unofficial [Laravel 3 docs](http://laravel3.veliovgroup.com/docs/install).

After you meet all Laravel's requirements, please proceed to next step:

--

#### Download sources
 - Go to GitHub
 - Download source code from master branch

--

#### Upload to server

To upload downloaded and edited files you may use build-in functionality of yours hosting-provider, something like "file management" or "FTP-management" or application which will provide direct access to your FTP-server, for example Forklift or Filezilla.

 - Connect to your FTP-server using url, login and password issued by your hosting provider
 - Go to root-folder of server, root-folder will sounds like www , home , home/username , html or http | Attention! Name of root-folder depends from server and hosting settings
 - Drag'n'Drop, copy&past or upload all downloaded and files from GitHub

--

#### Setting up the server side

After uploading all files into your server you need to change rights to public/upload & storage folders you need to make them writable.
 - Go to your server root folder
 - Find there `/public/upload`, `/storage` and `applications/models` folders
 - Change permissions to 777 and apply this to All included items

More info: http://laravel3.veliovgroup.com/docs/install#basic-configuration

Also you need to make /public folder as root for your HTTP server, for example (Apache):


```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    DocumentRoot /Users/JonSnow/Sites/MySite/public
    ServerName mysite.dev
</VirtualHost>
```


More info: http://laravel3.veliovgroup.com/docs/install#server-configuration

If you have no idea or no possibility to edit server's settings (for example at shared hosting) - the .htaccess in root folder will do all work for you.

If you will expect any issues with routing to /public at first try to remove .htaccess from root folder

#### Setting up Application Key
Secret application key. It's extremely important that you change the application key option before working on your site. This key is used throughout the framework for encryption, hashing, etc.

Method #1:
 - Go to downloaded folder from GitHub (indira-master)
 - Then find application.php in application/config/
 - Open the application.php in in text-editor or in any code-editor, for example: Notepad++ (Win), Sublime 2 (All platforms)
 - Find the line 'key' => '' and place value about 32 characters of random gibberish

Method #2:
 - Login to Admin Side (yourdomain.com/admin)
 - Then go to Settings (Wrench icon) -> CLI (yourdomain.com/admin/cli)

 - !Note: you may meet permissions issue with writable file (/application/config/application.php)
